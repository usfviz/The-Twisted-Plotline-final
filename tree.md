A champion's Score is also known as their KDA ratio, or ratio of Kills plus Assists divided by Deaths. The higher the score is, the better an individual champion is at adding value to their team. This treemap is a representation of champions based off their role, play count, and Score. The size of a box is the number of times a role or champion is played, while the darker shades of blue indicate a higher Score, and therefore indicates more value in their individual performance. Some champions may be played less due to difficulty, yet are very useful with respect to Score when played well.
