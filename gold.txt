One of the most important factors to winning is generating more gold than the other team. Gold is generated by kills, assists, and minion kills, and by doing these things more than the other team one is able to buy stronger items earlier in the game. If a team is able to jump out to a quick gold lead, in approximately 20 or 25 minutes, it is much more likely they will be able to have a quicker game. However, if a game ends up over 60 minutes, the gold difference no longer matters, as there are a maximum number of items one can buy. The solid lines represent the moving average.
